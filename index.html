      <p>This is the classic game of Dots and Squares.</p>
      <p>
        This is a 2 player game. The dots represent the corners of squares on the game board. Players take turns
        selecting sides of the squares between those points. Once a side is selected it will automatically be drawn on
        the game board. If the side the player selected completes a square then the box will be filled in with that
        players color and a point will be awarded. Player 1 then gets to take another turn. Player 1 is red and Player 2
        is blue. The oject of the game is to close mores quares than the other player.
